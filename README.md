### **Ad Image Engagement Prediction Using ResNet50**  

This project focuses on developing an **image classification model** using the **ResNet50** architecture to analyze ad images and evaluate their engagement potential based on visual elements. 
Leveraging **transfer learning**, the model is fine-tuned to recognize key factors such as **color schemes, object placement, which influence audience interaction.  

By the end of this project, the trained model will be optimized for real-world **digital marketing and advertising applications**, helping businesses predict ad performance and refine creative strategies for higher engagement.
